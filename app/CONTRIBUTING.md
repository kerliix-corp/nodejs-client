Welcome to the **Kerliix Outh Portal hub Internal Web Platform** repository.

## Contribution Requirements

All contributions must go through internal planning and adhere to our product, security, and design standards.

### Planning & Tasks

- All work must originate from a task in our internal issue tracking system (e.g., Jira).
- Only begin a task that has been assigned or approved by a team lead or project manager.

### Development Standards

- Maintain **clean, readable**, and **well-documented** code.
- Include relevant **unit tests**, **integration tests**, and **visual regression testing** if applicable.
- Always perform **local testing** before opening a pull request.

### Commit Message Format

Use clear and consistent commit messages. Follow this format:

[type]: short description

_Optional body explaining what and why._

### Examples:

- `feat: add new contact form to footer`
- `fix: correct alignment issue in hero banner on mobile`
- `chore: update dependencies and fix minor linter warnings`

### Code Review Process

- At least **one senior developer or team lead** must approve the PR before merging.
- All design-related updates must be reviewed by the **design owner or UX lead**.

## Branching Strategy

We follow a strict branching model:

- `main` — Production-ready code (auto-deployed)
- `develop` — Staging integration branch
- `feature/*` — New features (branch from `develop`)
- `bugfix/*` — Bug fixes (branch from `develop`)
- `hotfix/*` — Critical production fixes (branch from `main`, then merged back)

> ⚠️ **Never commit directly to `main` or `live`.** All changes must be made through branches and pull requests.

This repository and all of its contents are **confidential and proprietary** to **Kerliix Corporation**.

- Do **not** share, clone, mirror, or replicate this project to external systems.
